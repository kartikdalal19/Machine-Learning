# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **content-based movie recommendation system** built using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn. It takes a movie title as input and returns a list of similar movies based on their content features. A simple Flask web interface is provided to allow users to interact with the system via a browser.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The dataset contains movie details like title, genre, overview, keywords, cast, and crew.
2. These features are combined and vectorized using `CountVectorizer`.
3. Cosine similarity is calculated between movie vectors.
4. Based on similarity scores, the top 5 similar movies are recommended.
